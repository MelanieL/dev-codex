## Inspiration üìö

<!-- Todo: add some b-Movie posters for visuals -->

A few years ago I created a project called [Front-End Codex](https://github.com/MelanieL/front_end_codex) (deprecated/archived). It was meant to be a public listing of all the tools I liked to use, even the ones I don't use often. At the time I also wanted to try building a project using some basic Bootstrap.

I find myself in regular conversations with other devs where I mention a tool or resource that I'd like to connect them with. I also prefer something easy so I don't have to sign into Google every time I want to access to one bookmark. This is a solid (and safe!) solution for these problems.

I decided to create a new version of that project using some different tools. My "toolbox" has changed over the years, and so have my skills to build a project like this.

I also want a simple project where I can practice the basics (HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, SCSS/SASS). Sometimes it's nice when you read about updates, especially to HTML and CSS, to have a practical place to try them out.

I hope you find some things here that you can use!

### Recommended Extension for VS Code

You may run into errors with the JS modules if you aren't previewing with HTTP. I recommend using the Live Server extension on VS Code to run a simple local server.
